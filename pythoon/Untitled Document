type(100) --- int
type(100/3) --- float
int(5.5) --- 5
float(7) --- 7.0
Int and float is also a function.

100 // 3 --- 100
Used it a lot for example what page you are in.
It rounds it down.

type(10 > 11)  ---- bool

x >= 0 and x<= 100
0 <= x <= 100

0 is falsey
"" is falsey

%histroy
%histroy -n 

and or not

back slash if you have a comma like 'what\'s up'

1)

"123"
int("123") --- 123
string other way around

price = 7
"The price is 7 NIS"
" The price is" + str(price) + "NIS"

2)

"The price is %d NIS" %price
%d is like a placeholder.
two variables
"Thep rice is %ds NIS. Discount: %s NIS. " %(price, price/11)
"Thep rice is %.2f NIS. Discount: %.2f NIS. " %(price, price/11) -- 2 floats.


3)

"The price is {} NIS.format(price)"
"The price is {} NIS. Discount {}.format(price,price/11)"
"The price is {0:.2f} NIS. Discount {0:2.f}.format(price,price/11)"

4)
f"The price is {price:.2f} NIS"
f-strings

input("what is your name") like prompt

x = 435
assert x < 1000, "x is not allowed in range"

for month,v in x:


TESTING
test_
pycharm will know its a file of testing

def test_one_plus_one_is_two():
	assert 1 + 1 == 2

def test_one_plus_one_is_three():
	assert 1 + 1 == 3


def test_divide_by_zero():
	x / 0

def not_a_test():
	assert Flase, "!!!!"


just write pytest in the terminal

pytest-v will tell you who passed or not

file > settongs? pytest
Default test runner: pytest
crt;+shift+f10

first write the tests then the functions
