<!-- Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!
● Create a book object, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title, the author and
whether or not you have already read this book
● Create a few instances of this object
● Create a global method that logs the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".
● Write a function that logs all the books that have not been read yet, and call it. -->
