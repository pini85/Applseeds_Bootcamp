<!-- Question
create Player class.
It should have the following attributes:
name
score â€“ set to 0 at creation
1. Create a player instance.
2. make sure that his score equals to 0 (using code!)
3. write a play function: play(player)
Function description:
generate a random number between 1-10
if the number if even, the player wins -> increment the player score by 1.
Write a global function that will run the play function 3 times and returns the player's final score. -->
