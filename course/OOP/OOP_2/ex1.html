<!-- Create Shoes constructor.
It should have the following attributes:
name, available sizes and a method that checks if a specific size is available.
Create an instance.
For that instance check to see if a specific size is available.
Check once for an available size, and once for an unavailable size.
For example we could have shoes called “star Shoes” with available sizes: 36,38,44.
so when we check if size 36 is available we get true.
When we check if size 46 is available we get false. -->
