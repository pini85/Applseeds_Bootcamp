<!-- Write a class called Point, which represents a point in two-dimensional space.
A point has x and y properties, given as arguments to its constructor.
point example:
(3,0) : x=3, y=0
It also has a single method plus, which takes another point and returns a new point that is the sum of the two points.
That is, a new point whose x is the sum of the x properties of the original point and the other point,
and whose y is the sum of their y properties.
Make sure that the plus method returns a new point. -->
