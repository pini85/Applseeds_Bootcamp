Question Create a school object. Your school has teachers (at least 2) that can
teach certain subjects and are limited as per how many kids they can teach. The
teacherâ€™s students need to be tracked. The school also has students (at least 4)
that need to learn a certain subject (just 1). Create a function called
"assignStudent" that will check if there is a teacher is available to teach this
student, and if yes assign that student to the teacher (that student will be
added to the list of students of that teacher). Assign as many students as
possible.
