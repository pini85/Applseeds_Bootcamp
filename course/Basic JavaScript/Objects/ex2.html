an empty object bookUtils (utils = short for utilities). 3. add to to the

setNewEdition, that recieves a book and an edition year and sets a new property
latestEdition with the edition year, or updates an existing one. 5. add to to
the bookUtils object a setLanguage function, that recieves a book and a language

6. add to to the bookUtils object a setTranslation function, that recieves a
book a language and a translator, and sets a new property of translation, which
is an object that contains the translator and the language. 7. add to to the
bookUtils object a setPublisher function, that recieves a book a name and a
location, and sets a new property named publisher, which is an object that
contains the name and location. 8. add to to the bookUtils object a function
