Javascript basics:

ex1) Task2)
If I wrap the input as a parseInt and you type a letter it will give you NaN as the result.
Also the schools solution does so. Please look at my solution.
Maybe change it so that the student will set a variable that is a string or a number and then pass it to the flow. So then you can really see what typeof does. this is easier. Or was it meant to be more challenging? Im guessing not, because this is just the first excerise.

Also change the task3 solution to be without a parseInt


- I believe Geek out ex4 is harder than Geek out ex5. Maybe switch them around?

ex2)
Schools solution is way off.
