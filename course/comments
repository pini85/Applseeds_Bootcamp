Javascript basics:

ex1) Task2)
If I wrap the input as a parseInt and you type a letter it will give you NaN as the result.
Also the schools solution does so.
Maybe change it so that the student will set a variable that is a string or a number and then pass it to the flow. So then you can really see what typeof does.
Also change the task3 solution to be without a parseInt


- I believe Geek out ex4 is harder than Geek out ex5. Maybe switch them around?
