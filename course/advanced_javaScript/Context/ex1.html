let dog = {
    name: "sparky"
};
let black_dog = {
    name: "blacky"
}
const x16 = dog;

//  First with this code  
x16 = black_dog;

// And now with this code
dog.name = "blacky";
x16;

// What will be the output of the 2 executions? 
/** First time ther will be an error TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
Because we can't reasign in x16 a different object. 
Second time x16 will be an pbject with name = "blacky". Here we didn't change the 
object in x16 only it's attribute.
