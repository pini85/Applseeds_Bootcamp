JS Basics
Day 1:
Exercise 2
Because exercise 3 and 4 is guessing the output no hands on coding. Also you can show in exercise 2 how to solve the same problem with built in functions if one wanted to.
Excerise 1
If 

Day 2:
Debugging:
Exercise 3
Because this bug can happen quite often at the beginning for the coding jounrey.

Day 3:
Arrays and functions:
Excerise 2
Because the answer is best to use the reduce method ( which is also a ninja ex) which the lecture slides did not cover. Also for the ninja part can use the concat method.

Day 4:
Objects:
Ex3
Because this will give you the feel of a real life simulation with the crud principle on objects.




Day 5:
Event driven programming:
Ex3
Because the students can understand they can use string methods on dom values that are stored in variables.

Day 6:
DOM
ex2 
if we would use event.target with the addeventListener its good for them to see this because they will use this alot. 
If we just target the button then
ex4
Because here we use the eventlistener, loop through buttons, remove classnames. Its important for them to understand how this works.

Day 7:
Advanced JS
Ex3 booster
Because the other ones are easier. With all the excerises you don't need to really google anything. But Ex3 demands more.

Day 8:
Local Storage and 2d arrays
Ex4
Local storage question (ex3) is very basic. The most challenging excerise is Ex4 because it really makes you think on how to manipulate 2d arrays with the for loop. A close second is ex1.
