JS Basics
Day 1:
Exercise 2
Because exercise 3 and 4 is guessing the output no hands on coding. Also you can show in exercise 2 how to solve the same problem with built in functions if one wanted to.

Day 2:
Debugging:
Exercise 3
Because this bug can happen quite often at the beginning for the coding jounrey.

Day 3:
Arrays and functions:
Excerise 2
Because the answer is best to use the reduce method ( which is also a ninja ex) which the lecture slides did not cover. Also for the ninja part can use the concat method.

Day 4:
Objects:
Ex3
Because this will give you the feel of a real life simulation with the crud principle on objects.

Day 5:
Event driven programming:
Ex3
Because the students can understand they can use string methods on dom values that are stored in variables.
