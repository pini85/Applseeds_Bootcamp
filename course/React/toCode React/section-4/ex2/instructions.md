2. Creating a Star Wars movie component
   In the lesson, we saw how to create a component that shows Star Wars figure data by retrieving information from the https://swapi.co/api/people/1/ path. Write a new component that shows and displays movie information.

Movies information on the same API is available at https://swapi.co/api/films, so for example, the movie's "Revenge of the Sith" movie information is:

https://swapi.co/api/films/6/
You need to write a React component showing the movie name and the director's name.

Try to think - is there a common code between this component and the character component we wrote together? Do you have any idea how to consolidate the common code so there is no duplication of code?
