Build a page that contains 3 text boxes: one shows a few seconds, the other a few minutes and the third a few hours. Any change in value in one of the boxes should affect the values ​​in the other boxes, so that the time displayed in all 3 boxes will be adjusted.

For example, when a user writes 60 in the seconds box, 1 must be displayed in the minutes box and 0.016 in the hour box.
